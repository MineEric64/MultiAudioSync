 > Perfect-Synchronized Surround System for Multi Audio Devices

This program compensates the audio device's delay to syncronize your multi audio devices.
> So you can make a surround system **even if your audio device doesn't support official surround system.**

## Features
![image1](https://github.com/MineEric64/MultiAudioSync/blob/main/docs/image1.jpg?raw=true)

- Delay Compensation Mechanism
  - from Audio Capture Device
  - from Audio File

I recommend using **Audio Capture Device** mechanism.
